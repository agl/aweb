AWEB - Literate programming with C and HTML.

AWEB is a literate programming[1] system like Knuth's CWEB[2]. The difference
being that AWEB generates HTML for the weave output and the tangle output is
still readable source code, rather than the compressed form which CWEB
generates.

In order to build it, you'll need GHC[3] installed:

  ghc -O --make aweb

The code is a bit of a mess. And it's not even written in AWEB! :)

LSMSB[4] is written in AWEB, you can use that as an example. The file extension
for AWEB files is '.aw'.

Quick syntax guide:

The start of the file is the prelude, which is copied verbatim into the output.
It should include the HTML boilerplate for the output and should end up since
the <body> tag.

All directive lines start with @. Mostly, they are required to be at the start
of the line.

@/ Starts a section. The headline of the section follows on the same line, after
a space:

  @/ Heading

In a section, there is some amount of HTML, followed by a code snippet. The code
snippet starts with @<:

  @<snippet name@>=

The code snippet can also have a presentation name. The presentation name is
used in the weave output, but all references to the snippet must use the true
name (which must be unique):

  @<snippet name|Presentation name@>=

The code snippet is terminated either by the end of the file, or by a @/ line
starting the next section.

Within the code snippet, other sections can be referenced via:

  @<other snippet name@>

This directive need not start at the first character of the line, but all
characters before it need to be whitespace.

In order to output source files, there is a specific section:

  @{file filename.c

This replaces a @/ line and contains a code snippet which is expanded into the
contents of the file.

Within the HTML sections, @@cite:snippet name@@ will generate a fragment
reference to the given snippet. Use it like:

  See <a href="@@cite:snippet name@@">above</a>

In the prelude,

  @@TOC

on a line will cause an table of contents to be included. The table of contents
is generated from sections which are marked as headings. Replace the @/ with
something like:

  @/* Top level heading

or

  @/** Second level heading
